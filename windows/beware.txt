 = AN IMPORTANT NOTE =

Jorts is primarily a Linux app. It is built using linux toolkits, and bundles a lot of it in the installer.
We really only did it for Windows to share it to friends.

The Windows Build has a few differences with the True OG:
 - There is no seasonal icons, such as Halloween or Pride app icons.
You will always have the Blueberry, standard icon.

 - There is no inbuilt update method.
 You will have to uninstall Jorts, then reinstall it with a new version to update.
Note about this one: Notes are not deleted on uninstall. Do not worry you wont lose them.

 - There is no setting to enable/disable Jorts starting with Windows.
The Installer sets it once, then it is between you and God.

 - There may be some very edge case bugs.
As i write this, the looking glass in the search field of the emoji chooser does not show up. I dont fucking know why.

If you report bugs on Github, please mention that you are using the app on Windows, and ideally your level of technical knowledge so we can respond in a way that does not make you dissociate
It cost us a couple grey hairs, so if you can consider donating on our Ko-Fi we would really love it
